## 🌿 About Me

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

I enjoy learning new tech stacks, love cooking and baking, staying active outdoors, and ending my weekends with a list of starred K-dramas and a bowl of popcorn.

I value consistency, growth, and building technology that solves real problems.

Always open to collaboration and meaningful projects.
